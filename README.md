CodefyPHP is __not__ a framework such as the likes of Symfony, Laravel, Codeigniter or CakePHP. Codefy is a simple, 
light framework providing interfaces and implementations for architecting a Domain Driven project with 
CQRS, Event Sourcing and implementations of [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3), 
[PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6), [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7), 
[PSR-11](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11), [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/), 
[PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15), [PSR-16](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16) 
and [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17).

The philosophy of Codefy is that code should be systematized, maintainable, and follow OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). 
CodefyPHP tries not to be too opinionated, yet encourages best practices and coding standards by following [Qubus Coding 
Standards](https://github.com/QubusPHP/qubus-coding-standard). Use Codefy as you see fit. You can tap into all, some or 
none of the features and instead use the interfaces to build your own implementations for a domain driven project.

## üìò Documentation

Documentation is still a work in progress. Between the [Qubus Components](https://docs.qubusphp.com/) documentation 
and [CodefyPHP's](https://codefyphp.com/documentation/) documentation, that should help you get started. If you have questions or 
need help, feel free to ask for help in the [forums](https://codefyphp.com/community/).

## üôå Sponsors

If you use CodefyPHP or you are interested in supporting the continued development of my opensource projects, 
please consider sponsoring me via [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/parkerj) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/nomadicjosh). 

## üñã Contributing

CodefyPHP could always be better! If you are interested in contributing enhancements or bug fixes, here are a few 
rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before I accept and merge your work. 
- You MUST follow the [QubusPHP Coding Standards](https://github.com/QubusPHP/qubus-coding-standard).
- You MUST write (or update) unit tests.
- You SHOULD write documentation.
- Please, write [commit messages that make sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), 
and rebase your branch before submitting your Pull Request.
- Please [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) too.
This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (I don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, 
etc.).

## üîê Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability in the code, please email [joshua@joshuaparker.dev](mailto:joshua@joshuaparker.dev).
