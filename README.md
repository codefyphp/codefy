CodefyPHP is not a full-fledged framework such as the likes of Symfony, Laravel, Codeigniter or CakePHP. Codefy is a simple 
framework providing contracts and abstractions for architecting a Domain Driven project with 
CQRS, Event Sourcing and implementations of [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3), 
[PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6), [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7), 
[PSR-11](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11), [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/), 
[PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15), [PSR-16](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16) 
and [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17).

The philosophy of Codefy is that code should be systematized, maintainable, and follows OOP. CodefyPHP tries not be 
too opinionated, yet encourages best practices and coding standards by following [Qubus Coding 
Standards](https://github.com/QubusPHP/qubus-coding-standard).

## Requirement
- PHP 8.2+
- Additional constraints based on which components are used.

## üèÜ Features

- Robust [dependency injector](https://docs.qubusphp.com/injector/dependency-injector/) for bootstrapping

- Provides a simple hook and event system without affecting core code
- Encourages object-oriented programming
